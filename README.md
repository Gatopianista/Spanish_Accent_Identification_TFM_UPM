# Spanish_Accent_Identification_TFM_UPM
Master on Automation and Robotics - final project

This repository contains algorithms and scripts developed during my final project in order to 
obtain the master degree on Automation and Robotics at UPM. 

The project consists on the training of several models using and RNN-LSTM architecture to determine the best 
set of features extracted from audio of spanish speakers from Spain and Argentina, to detect these two accents, 
through the aforementioned methodology.
